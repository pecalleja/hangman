## [Hangman (Python)](https://hyperskill.org/projects/69)
I developed a Python-based Hangman game as part of a project on JetBrains Academy. This text-based recreation of the classic puzzle game challenges players to guess a word letter by letter before running out of chances. The project was an excellent opportunity to sharpen my skills in Python, particularly with functions, loops, lists, and the random module.

Hangman is a popular yet grim puzzle game. A cruel computer hides a word from you, which you try to guess letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be “hanged”. If you win, you'll survive. You’ve probably played the game at least once or twice. Now you can actually create this game yourself!
