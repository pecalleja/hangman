## [Hangman (Python)](https://hyperskill.org/projects/69)
I developed a Python-based Hangman game as part of a project on JetBrains Academy. This text-based recreation of the classic puzzle game challenges players to guess a word letter by letter before running out of chances. The project was an excellent opportunity to sharpen my skills in Python, particularly with functions, loops, lists, and the random module.
